### Description
A Next.js project of a website where people can enter a Github username and get the main information about him, like:
* Profile photo
* Name
* Numbers of followers
* Numbers of following
* Bio
* Repositories

To get these information, the Github API was used --> see the [REST API - Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/pt/rest)

### What I used:
* Next.js
* Typescript
* Sass
* Axios
